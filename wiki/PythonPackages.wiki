    On my test bed I built the gdal source, then installed into the default
    directory. In python when calling "from osgeo import gdal" I kept getting
    an error saying libgdal.so.1 could not be found. Doing an ldd on _gdal.so in the 
    site-packages dir for the gdal package, I saw that the shared object couldn't be
    found. Unsure why that was, I tried adding a soft link in a couple of places to 
    no avail. I ended up editing ld.so.conf and added /usr/local/lib, which is where
    on Debian the default installation of the gdal libs went. Then ran ldconfig and
    another ldd _gdal.so showed the library could then be found. I am unsure of where
    it was looking initally.
